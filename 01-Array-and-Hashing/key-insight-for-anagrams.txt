/**
 * Key Insights:
 * 
 * 1. Anagrams have the same characters with same frequency
 *    - "act" and "cat" both have: 1a, 1c, 1t
 * 
 * 2. Two ways to identify anagrams:
 *    a) Sort strings - anagrams become identical when sorted
 *    b) Count character frequency - create unique key
 * 
 * 3. Hash map is perfect for grouping
 *    - Key: identifier (sorted string or frequency key)
 *    - Value: list of anagrams
 * 
 * 4. Approach 2 is faster (no sorting)
 *    - O(n*k) vs O(n*k log k)
 *    - But uses slightly more complex key creation
 * 
 * Edge Cases Handled:
 * - Empty string: ""
 * - Single character: "x"
 * - Single string in input
 * - All strings are anagrams
 * - No anagrams at all
